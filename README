PLEASE READ THIS FILE CAREFULLY BEFORE HAND

This is mainly document of this project. Initially the project is built up
on a Windows server so that I assume I'm using it on Windows below. The final
wrapper is platfrom independent and I have tested it on some Linux systems
already.

====================================================================
How to use

1. Download latest vSphere SDK from VMware site. Currently the link is 
http://www.vmware.com/support/developer/vsphere_mgmt_sdk/index.html. 

2. Download the gSOAP package. We need only those two binaries: soapcpp2.exe
and wsdl2h.exe.

3. Dwonload OpenSSL package, which is required on build the soutce

4. Unzip the those packages to somewhere. Assume you put VMware SDK at C:\SDK
   folder.

5. Execute
   vim,pl -p <wsdl_file> [output folder]

   This command will generate all necessary client stub code by gSOAP tools.

   For example:
   vim,pl -p C:\SDK\vsphere-ws\wsdl\vim25\vimService.wsdl C:\wrapper

   Make sure gSOAP binaries is $PATH environemnt variable

6. Execute
   vim.pl -e <vim_sdk_help_path>

   This command will extract all necessary type information from SDK document.

   For example:
   vim.pl -e C:\SDK\vsphere-ws\docs\ReferenceGuide

7. Execute
   vim.pl -g [output folder]

   This command will generate all the wrapper codes and. additional, CLI MOB
   browser codes.

   For example:
   vim.pl -g C:\wrapper

Now, you should find follwoing source files under C:\wrapper folder:
    soapC.cpp
    soapdefs.h
    soapH.h
    soapStub.h
    soapVimBindingProxy.cpp
    soapVimBindingProxy.h
    stdsoap2.cpp
    stdsoap2.h
    VimBinding.nsmap
    vim_browser.cpp
    vim_browser.h
    vim_wrapper.cpp
    vim_wrapper.h

Except the last four files, all other files are generated by gSOAP.

If you just want to the wrapper, there are! Just add vim_wrapper.cpp and
vim_wrapper.cpp to your project and do what you want to. However if you
want to build the CLI Managed Object Browser or know how the wrapper are 
used in a really project, you need build all those source files (include
another two: main.cpp and helper.h) into a binary.

=======================================================
Build the CLI MOB
Create an empty project and add all those files in. Before build the project,
you need to do following setting:

1. specify the include path of OpenSSL

2. Specify the library path of OpenSSL

3. Define macro WITH_OPENSSL, WITH_SOAPDEFS_H and WITH_COOKIES.

4. Add additional build option /bigobj as one of gSOAP generated source file 
   is very big

5. Add libeay32.lib and ssleay32.lib to linker

That it! Build the project and you'll get a binary. With it you can browse the
objects of an ESX server just as you did with that HTML based browser. The
syntax is:
   <your_app_name> ip_address user_name password

Enjoy it!
